# Global-Energy-Generation-and-the-Carbon-Challenge
Using Tableau for Data Visualization

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes global energy trends between 2000 and 2022, focusing on the adoption of renewable and non-renewable energy sources and their impact on carbon emissions. The dataset used in this analysis comes from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and includes parameters such as electricity generation capacity, energy sources, and public investments in energy infrastructure.

By visualizing this data in Tableau, we aim to uncover key insights about the global shift toward renewable energy and its role in mitigating carbon emissions.

## 🔍 Key Features

Energy Mix by Country: A breakdown of renewable vs. non-renewable energy sources for each country.
Trends Over Time: Visualizing growth in renewable energy capacity (e.g., wind, solar) compared to traditional sources (coal, oil, gas) from 2000 to 2021.
Carbon Emissions Estimation: Estimating carbon emissions based on non-renewable energy generation and standard emission factors for coal, oil, and natural gas.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Key columns in the dataset include:

Country: The country for which data is being analyzed.

Year: The year of the energy data.

Electricity Installed Capacity (MW or GW): Total capacity for each energy source (renewable and non-renewable).

Electricity Generation (MWh): Total electricity generated from each energy source.

Proxy Carbon Emissions: Estimated emissions based on energy sources and emission factors.

## ⚙ Analysis Tools

Tableau: The primary tool for visualizing data trends and generating interactive dashboards.

Excel: Used for initial data examination. 

Python: Used for cleaning and and calculation of proxy carbon emissions based on standard emission factors.


## 📈 Visualizations

Key dashboards available in this project:

1. Renewable vs. Non-Renewable Energy: A comparison of electricity generation and installed capacity by energy source across different countries.
2. Yearly Growth of Renewable Energy: Tracking the increase in renewable energy sources (solar, wind) from 2000 to 2022.
3. Carbon Emissions Estimation: Visualizing carbon emissions based on non-renewable energy generation using proxy emission factors.
4. Country Comparison: Insights into which countries are leading the transition to renewables and which are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels.
 

## 📌 Key Insights

- Non-renewable energy dominance: Mali, India, and Ecuador rely heavily on non-renewables, while Brazil, China, and the USA generate most of their electricity from renewables.

- Hydropower leads, wind and solar rising: Hydropower remains the most significant renewable source, though wind and solar are rapidly increasing their share.

- Carbon emissions linked to non-renewables: Oil and natural gas contribute the most to carbon emissions, with Ivory Coast emitting the highest amount through oil.

- Regional emissions imbalance: Despite generating less electricity, the Americas emit more carbon than both Asia and Africa.


## 🏁 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the global shift toward renewable energy but also highlights the continued reliance on non-renewable sources, which drive significant carbon emissions. Countries like Brazil and China are leading in renewable energy generation, yet regions like Africa and Asia, despite high electricity output, contribute less to carbon emissions compared to the Americas.

The data underscores the urgent need for accelerated adoption of renewable energy to reduce the environmental impact of electricity generation. The positive correlation between carbon emissions and electricity generation shows that more must be done to transition from fossil fuels and embrace cleaner energy sources.
